Inheritance

Of course, a language feature would not be worthy of the name “class” without supporting inheritance.
The syntax for a derived class definition looks like this:

class DerivedClassName(BaseClassName):
    <statement-1>
    .
    .
    .
    <statement-N>
The name BaseClassName must be defined in a scope containing the derived class definition.
In place of a base class name, other arbitrary expressions are also allowed. 
This can be useful, for example, when the base class is defined in another module:
class DerivedClassName(modname.BaseClassName):
