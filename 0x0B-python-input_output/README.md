Reading and Writing Files
open() returns a file object, and is most commonly used with
two positional arguments and one keyword argument: open(filename, mode, encoding=None)

>>>
f = open('workfile', 'w', encoding="utf-8")
The first argument is a string containing the filename.
The second argument is another string containing a few characters describing
the way in which the file will be used. mode can be 'r' when the file will only be read,
'w' for only writing (an existing file with the same name will be erased),
and 'a' opens the file for appending; any data written to the file is automatically added to the end.
'r+' opens the file for both reading and writing. The mode argument is optional; 'r' will be assumed if itâ€™s omitted.

Normally, files are opened in text mode, that means, you read and write strings from and to the file, 
which are encoded in a specific encoding. If encoding is not specified, the default is platform dependent (see open()). 
Because UTF-8 is the modern de-facto standard, encoding="utf-8" is recommended 
unless you know that you need to use a different encoding. Appending a 'b' to the mode opens the file in binary mode.
Binary mode data is read and written as bytes objects. You can not specify encoding when opening file in binary mode.
